# 👋 Hey, I'm Mickael

### Software Engineer • Software Architect • Builder

I design and build software systems, tools and prototypes — from desktop applications to backend services and interactive concepts.

- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, architecture, automation, data workflows, and interactive systems/gaming concepts.

- 🌱 My work focuses on:
  - Software architecture & system design  
  - Backend development 
  - Automation & data parsing  
  - Desktop apps 
  - Prototypes for digital tools and interactive experiences
    
- 💾 I progressively publish selected components, utilities and experimental projects here.
